How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by testing it exhaustively. There are many types of tests that can be applied to the software to ensure that all requirements are met.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are interpreted by organizing them into requirements and user stories. These user stories are then used as guidelines when coding new parts of the program.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with a test early and often attitude. I understand that ensuring my code is working correctly as I go is much more efficient than waiting until a lot of code is written. I also design software with user requirements as the main source of ideas. This is to ensure that the program is to the clientâ€™s satisfaction.
